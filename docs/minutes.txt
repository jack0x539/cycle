Cycling Projects - 31/10/2018

Issues with current system
- bad data on "new" clients
- age range, when really DOB is needed, for reports and dynamicness!

-record weather conditions

-want to see something by february
-directly run at 25 out of 60 wheels for all centres, want all of them and everyone to use the same DB!
-need to collect up volenteer activity and hours
-tot up income, could be fees or donation
-ability to tie donations to events as this wouldnt be counted against fee income
-fee can be different for events and locations, can be waived per participant, donations can be made to the event;
 sometimes people are affiliated with an organisation who will be invoiced instead of the participant paying on the day

 -report on new participant, be it new to the authority, or the system or the activity type
 
 -record notes against people
 -record equipment used, default to unselected maybe
 
 - person types - staff, voulenteer, participant, carers
 - voulenteer hour override per event
 - voulenteer type unskilled, skilled and professional
 - person type is per event, but with a deault perhaps
 
-event types 
	- peddle-away
	- wheels for all
	
- streamline OHQ
- onus on participant to say that they are healthy enough, not the voulenteer
- have to record careers as well as particpants and staff

- register interest in event when you fill in the OHQ, include location, date, notes? 
- potential to list running events per centre selected

-know the types of cycles available at each location, including condition? (this is a bigger thing, maybe leave for now)

- website requires permissions, must be at activity type and location granularity

- look into taking payments for events
- same for donations?

- ability to generate invoices for centres

- try wizard data entry for OHQ on mobile?
- how much effort for an app version? does anyone know apple development?
